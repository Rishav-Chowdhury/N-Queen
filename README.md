# N-Queen
This Web Application takes the number of queens as an input on the slider and computes the solutions by Backtracking and uses PyPlot to display the unique solutions visually.
It was created using Streamlit, which is a unique Python package for creating and deploying interactive Web Applications for Machine Learning Models. The Application is deployed on Heroku.

##Update:
I deployed the Web Application using Streamlit Sharing and it was so user-friendly.
